1;hello world
19;caesar cipher
11;for this problem you need to implement a program to break the caesar ciphers used to generate the ciphertexts from a given input file
6;the csumb community is committed to creating and fostering a positive learning and working environment based on open communication mutual respect and inclusion
22;secret key could be a number a word a string or a secret
3;cryptography studies the ability to send information between participants in a way that prevents other from reading it
26;this message does not need to be decrypted
16;a brute force attack tries all possible keys on some ciphertext until an intelligible translation into plaintext is obtained
12;cryptanalytic attacks try to exploit the characteristics of the algorithm to attempt to deduce a specific plaintext or the key being used
5;secret key cryptography is also referred as symmetric or conventional cryptography
